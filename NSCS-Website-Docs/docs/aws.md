# Welcome to AWS and S3 Guide!

## Why AWS?

We chose to use AWS (and S3) to store the website's images and uploads because it's super cheap, secure, and simple to use.

## How to upload to Gallery?

**In order to upload to the Gallery, you need two things:**

* AWS Username/Email
* AWS Password

Have those? Great! Let's get started.

* First, login to your console [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* Once logged in, in the upper left hand corner, you'll see a search bar. In the search bar, type in "s3" and choose the first result.
* You should be taken to a page that shows you all of your buckets.
* Choose the bucket called "nscs-gallery-upload-bucket".
* You should be taken to a page that has all of your Gallery contents listed. On the left side, there should be an "Upload" button. Click it (a pop-up will appear), upload your images, and click the "upload" button on the bottom left of the pop-up. **Important**: You can upload as many images as you want. **However, do not upload any folders or compressed/zipped folders**. These will not appear in the gallery. Also, any image file extension works, but JPEG and PNG are recommended to maximize load speeds and minimize storage costs.

* After the images are done uploading, go back to the Gallery page and refresh it. You should see all your images loading onto the page. If you click an image, it will open it in the broswer. To download it, anyone can right-click on it, and download from there.
