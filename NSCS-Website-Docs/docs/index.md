# Welcome to the NSCS Website Documentation!

## What is this?

This website is for whoever wants to learn how to use the brand new NSCS Member website. If you have questions, consult this website and browse its pages.

It is also important to note that on this site, the things a user sees depends on if they belong to the general public, the general NSCS member pool, or if they are a NSCS website admin.
